                    <h5>3. Refund Eligibility</h5>
                    <p>To be eligible for a refund, you must submit a request within 5 days of your subscription start date. Refunds may be considered on a case-by-case basis and are granted at the sole discretion of Orangemegasoftware.</p>
                    <p>Refund requests can be made if you encounter technical issues that prevent you from using our service and that cannot be resolved by our support team. Proof of the issue may be required.</p>

                    <h5>5. Refund Processing</h5>
                    <p>Once your refund request is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund. If approved, your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your original method of payment within a certain number of days. Please note that refunds can only be made back to the original payment method used at the time of purchase.</p>
